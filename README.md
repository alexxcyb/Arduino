# What is Arduino?
> [Arduino](https://arduino.cc) is an <strong>open-source</strong> electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online. You can tell your board what to do by sending a set of instructions to the microcontroller on the board. To do so you use the Arduino programming language (based on Wiring), and the <strong>Arduino Software (IDE)</strong>, based on Processing.
